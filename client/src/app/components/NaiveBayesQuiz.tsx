    question: "What is the main assumption of Naive Bayes?",
    options: [
      "Features are dependent on each other",
      "Features are conditionally independent",
      "Features are normally distributed",
      "Features are linearly separable"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Naive Bayes assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class, which is why it's called 'naive'."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Which theorem is the foundation of Naive Bayes?",
    options: [
      "Central Limit Theorem",
      "Bayes' Theorem",
      "Pythagorean Theorem",
      "Law of Large Numbers"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' Theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What is a common application of Naive Bayes?",
    options: [
      "Image recognition",
      "Time series forecasting",
      "Spam filtering",
      "Clustering"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Naive Bayes is particularly effective for text classification tasks like spam filtering due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is the 'zero probability problem' in Naive Bayes?",
    options: [
      "When the algorithm fails to converge",
      "When a feature value never appears in a class",
      "When the prior probability is zero",
      "When the posterior probability is zero"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The zero probability problem occurs when a feature value in the test data was not present in the training data for a particular class, leading to a zero probability."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Which of these is NOT a variant of Naive Bayes?",
    options: [
      "Gaussian Naive Bayes",
      "Multinomial Naive Bayes",
      "Bernoulli Naive Bayes",
      "Logistic Naive Bayes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "Logistic Naive Bayes is not a variant. The main variants are Gaussian (for continuous features), Multinomial (for discrete counts), and Bernoulli (for binary features)."
